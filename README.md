# CHERIoT_Experiments
Our experiments with the Secure CHERIoT Ibex core on the Sonata Board from lowRISC.

# Installing Development Environment on Windows
I'm not ashamed to admit that I use Visual Studio Code on Winodws as my preferred IDE (I just have too many otehr programs on there to be constantly switching back and forth with Linux). There are some user guides for setting up teh Sonata Board and the IDE but they don't all appear to be updated. I will document the entire process here with date and version information so that you can just for yourself.

## Sources of help and information
1. [Getting started with the Sonata board](https://lowrisc.github.io/sonata-system/doc/guide/index.html) This is the main documentation for the Sonata board and should be kept up to date.
2. [Sonata Software - Getting started guide](https://lowrisc.github.io/sonata-software/doc/getting-started.html) This is teh main documentation for the Sonata Software and should be kept up to date. This also includes a section on installing the IDE on Windows (using teh Windows Subsystem for Linux).
3. [From zero to CHERIoT in two minutes with Sonata](https://cheriot.org/fpga/ibex/2024/06/10/sonata-quick-start.html) This is teh first one that I treid and it didn't work for me. I was unable to get it to build and it assumed that I already had Docker installed (I did not at the time).
